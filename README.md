# Pressure_Measure_Control_C_MSP430
 embedded system to measure pressure and control to a specific pressure

Note: code developed with assistance of build in examples from the development kit.

Developed as part of my coop term at EMTS Lab. 
The business need was to test a product at a very high underwater depth. This was created by pressurizing the tank with water and submerging the product.
The systme was built to measure and control the pressure in real time. Quick solution was required to there may be a lack of comments.
